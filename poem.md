# Success.

**What is _success_?** In mad soul-suicide <br>
The world's vain spoils rapaciously to seize,<br>
To pamper the base appetite of pride,<br>
And live a lord in luxury and ease?<br>
Is this success, whereof so many prate? -<br>
To have the Midas-touch that turns to gold<br>
Earth's common blessings? to accumulate,<br>
And in accumulation to grow old?<br>

*Nay*, but to see and undertake with zest<br>
The good most in agreement with our powers,<br>
To strive, if need be, for the second best,<br>
But still to strive, and glean the golden hours,<br>
With eyes for nature, and a mind for truth,<br>
And the brave, loving, joyous heart of youth.<br>
